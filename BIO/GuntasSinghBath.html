<p align=center>My name is Guntas Singh Bath. I currently live in Windsor, Ontario and I am enrolled in Computer Networking Technician Course at St Clair College.
 Unlike most of my classmates, I moved here from Vancouver, British Columbia. I actually grew up in Jalandhar, which is the third largest city in Punjab, India.
 I have a younger brother who is back home studying Automobile Engineering. I am probably the biggest geek in my class, I'm sure.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>
I do not like travelling that much but I can say I have explored British Columbia fairly.<br />
I have visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler,_British_Columbia" style="color:red">Whistler</a> multiple times while I was in Vancouver.<br />
I have also explored most of the trails in North Vancouver hill area.<br />
I have been to Victoria Island too.<br />
I have seen the countryside of BC as well. It is truly "Beautiful British Columbia".<br />
<h2>Why I chose this Program?</h2>
I can sit in front of a computer for more time than an average person. I have studied programming languages since grade 6.<br /> 
It doesn't feel like programming to me anymore. Its like a walk in the park for me. I love figuring out a program's code.<br />
 I've always loved computers and always wanted to study them. Its like my dream course.
<h2> How I came to Canada</h2>
 Well, my story is just like anyone else's. The only difference is that its a bit old than my classmates. My plane touched down at Vancouver's airport on 27th of December, 2017.<br />
 I remember, it had just snowed really heavily that day. It was super chilly for me, even though I was wearing 2 jackets. 2 of my friends were there to receive me.<br />
 They then took me to see English Bay and the downtown of the city. We then went to a pool areana. Had a few mocktails, non alcoholic of course.<br />
The thrill, the excitement. It truly was once in a lifetime experience.<br />
